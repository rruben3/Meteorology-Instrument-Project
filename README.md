Meteorology Instrument Package Assignment

Introduction: 
For this project we looked at the Meteorology Instrument Package that measures the weather conditions at the sea surface. With this date we analyzed the patterns of rain rate and wind over the seawater and checked to see if there were correlations between the two. 

Using Jupyter Notebook coding in the python 3, I coded graphs and grabbed information from the .CSV files downloaded from the OOI Website. 

Looking at the graphs I can see that usually when the rain rate was lower, the wind velocity was also lower. 

The highest correlation between the two for the rain rate was around .75.

The highest correlation between the two for the velocity of the wind was around .75 as well. 

Looking at the graphs it seems like they are similar in both graphs comparting the lag of wind and rain rate. 

The rainiest times were definitely in the fall-spring time but there wasn't a very definitive area.
